Ursula's research is interdisciplinary, connecting her background in physics and her current interest in statistical data visualisation and its application.

She mostly works on high-dimensional problems and uses methods like the grand tour for visualisation of data beyond 3D. We can gain new physics insights by using better visualisations, but at the same time thinking about how to best plot the result also motivates us to develop new visualisation methods!
