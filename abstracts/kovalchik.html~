Moneyball launched a revolution in statistical thinking in sports. However, careers in sports statistics continue to be rare. Statisticians who have successfully found jobs in sport have often had to make a name for themselves before they could get a foot in the door in industry. Stories of this transition often involve a passionate hobbyist, who conducts sports analyses on the side, and eventually gains recognition by industry by publishing their research and ideas on the Web. In this talk, I will share my own version of this story and how I went from being a blogger on sports statistics to a data scientist at Tennis Australia. I will describe what my experience has taught me about the skills and tools that can help aspiring sports statisticians land the job of their dreams.
